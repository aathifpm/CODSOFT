# CODSOFT Machine Learning Internship

Hi! I'm Aathif Jameel PM, an Artificial Intelligence student at Panimalar Engineering College, Poonamalle. This repository contains my machine learning projects completed during my internship at CODSOFT.

## Projects

1. **Movie Genre Classification**
   - Built a machine learning model to predict movie genres based on plot descriptions
   - Used TF-IDF vectorization and Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier
   - Implemented multi-label classification to handle multiple genres per movie
   - Achieved good accuracy and F1-score metrics

2. **SMS Spam Detection** 
   - Developed a spam detection system for text messages
   - Used CountVectorizer and Naive Bayes for text classification
   - Achieved 98.5% accuracy in distinguishing spam from legitimate messages
   - Built a pre-trained model for real-time prediction

3. **Customer Churn Prediction**
   - Created models to predict customer churn for a bank
   - Implemented Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting
   - Performed feature engineering and data preprocessing
   - Best model achieved 86.7% accuracy

4. **Credit Card Fraud Detection**
   - Developed fraud detection system for credit card transactions
   - Used large dataset with anonymized transaction features
   - Implemented classification algorithms to identify fraudulent patterns
